1. Bash: Bash comes with Mac and Linux but is not natively installed on Windows. Bash is a powerful command line interface that allows you to efficiently manipulate files and directories. You will also use it to access and interact with Git (version control).

2. Git: Git is a tool that you use to keep track of changes in your documents. This makes your workflow more reproducible. It also allows you to undo changes that you want to undo!

3. Conda - Conda is a package and environment management tool that allows you to install Python packages on your computer as well as create and manage multiple Python environments, each containing different packages. To get started with conda and Python, you will install the Miniconda Python distribution, which provides both the conda package manager and a basic Python environment. You will then install the earth-analytics-python conda environment which provides a tested and easy-to-use conda environment with key packages needed to work with scientific data, including spatial data and more!


Run Bash commands to complete the following tasks: 

Open Git Bash in windows:
$

1. print the current working directory (pwd)
   $ pwd
2. navigate between directories on your computer (cd)
